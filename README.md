# Visual Speaking Buddy


# Project Objective: 
To allow users with speech difficulties communicate with others. 
To provide a story-telling companion, who can also play music
To provide relaxation and destress


# Project Description
The VSB will assist those with speech difficulties communicate with others, as well as their own story/music player. On the home screen there are typical images used for daily communication. When the user chooses an image, it will turn full-screen and a message will be played. For example, when a user clicks on an image with a bath, that image becomes full-screen and a message will be played, “Please run my bath”
Additionally, there is Dani. When a user feels stressed, upset or requires company, he can choose Dani. This sprite will then ask if he wants a story to be told or music to be played. Depending on what you choose, Dani will do the needful
Therefore, my app will be a multi-use tool that will not only help users communicate but also be their virtual buddy.
